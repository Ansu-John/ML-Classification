## Classification
### Logistic regression
Logistic regression is a popular method to predict a categorical response. It is a special case of Generalized Linear models that predicts the probability of the outcomes.

In spark.ml logistic regression can be used to predict a binary outcome by using binomial logistic regression, or it can be used to predict a multiclass outcome by using multinomial logistic regression.

### Decision tree classifier
Decision trees are a popular family of classification and regression methods. 

### Random forest classifier
Random forests are a popular family of classification and regression methods.

### Gradient-boosted tree classifier
Gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) are a popular classification and regression method using ensembles of decision trees. 

### Multilayer perceptron classifier
Multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) is a classifier based on the feedforward artificial neural network. MLPC consists of multiple layers of nodes.

### Linear Support Vector Machine
A support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.

### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic, multiclass classifiers based on applying Bayesâ€™ theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between every pair of features.
